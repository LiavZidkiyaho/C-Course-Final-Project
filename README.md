During the year 2022-2023, we had the opportunity to learn the C programming language in Magshimim with our amazing teacher and mentor: <a href="https://github.com/Roee-Bar">Roee Bar</a>.
At the end of the year, we were asked to create a project that will be able to load, save and create GIFs using openCV.
I had a lot of fun coding this project and i cant wait for next year.

<strong>This project is private because I don't want first-year Magshimim students to use my solution<strong>
